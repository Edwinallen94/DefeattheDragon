# DefeattheDragon
I developed my current repository by leveraging the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification from freeCodeCamp. Through this comprehensive certification, I gained proficiency in fundamental JavaScript concepts such as variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, and manipulating the DOM. Additionally, I delved into advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, and algorithmic thinking. Furthermore, I learned practical skills such as working with local storage and fetching data using APIs. With this solid foundation, I was able to create my repository, applying my knowledge to build a role-playing JavaScript game and implement various features effectively.
